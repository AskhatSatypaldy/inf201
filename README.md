This code appears to be an HTML document with accompanying JavaScript code. It creates a simple weather app that allows users to enter a location and retrieve weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. Let me explain the key components and functionality of this code:

Key HTML Elements:
- `.container`: This is the main container for the app's content.
- `.search-box`: This contains an input field for entering a location and a search button.
- `.not-found`: This is a section to display an error message for invalid locations.
- `.weather-box`: This section displays weather-related information, including an image, temperature, and weather description.
- `.weather-details`: This section displays additional weather details, such as humidity and wind speed.

JavaScript :
1. The JavaScript code defines a class called `WeatherDataAdapter`. This class is responsible for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and standardizing it.

2. An instance of the `WeatherDataAdapter` class, named `openWeatherAdapter`, is created with an API key.

3. The code selects various elements from the HTML document using the `document.querySelector` method and stores them in variables for later manipulation.

4. An event listener is added to the search button. When the button is clicked, the code fetches weather data for the specified city using the `openWeatherAdapter.fetchWeather(city)` method.

5. If the data is successfully retrieved, it updates the displayed weather information and hides the error message if it was previously displayed. If the data indicates an error (e.g., the city was not found), it displays the error message and hides the weather information.

6. The `WeatherDataAdapter` class includes methods for standardizing the received weather data and determining which weather image to display based on the weather condition.

7. The code uses Font Awesome icons for various elements, and it adds CSS classes to create fade-in animations for some elements.
